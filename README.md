# Project

## Description

This app allows users to set moods and share how they are feeling to eachother.

## How it works

It uses React Native for cross platform usage (IOS is not implemented or developed) and Firebase as a backend service so that no local hosting is needed.

## Usage

Use this however you see fit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Ensure NodeJS is installed, and run `npm i` to install necessary node packages.
3. Run `npx expo run:android:` with an android emulator to try it.
