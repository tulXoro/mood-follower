# Project

## Description

This app allows users to set moods and share how they are feeling to eachother.

## How it works

It uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for cross platform usage (IOS is not implemented or developed) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a backend service so that no local hosting is needed.

## Usage

Use this however you see fit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed, and run `npm i` to install necessary node packages.
3. Create a Firebase application and create a new file in the `lib` folder with all the configuration settings.
4. Run `npx expo run:android` with an android emulator to try it.
